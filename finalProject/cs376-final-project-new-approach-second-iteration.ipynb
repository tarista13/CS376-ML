We start by choosing an exisitng essay and using an machine learning model to create an intial outlien of it. This outline is then check and corrected by a person to make sure it is accurate and relevant. After that, we use the corrected outlien to help the ML model write a neew version of the essay.\n\nTo check if our method works well, we compare the original essay written by a human with the new one written by the model. We look closely to each word(token) in both essays and calculate how well each word fits. If the model's word fits better, we replace the orignal word with teh AI's choice. This process lets us try out different ways of giving information to the model, like using just the original essay, the corrected outline, both together, the outline made by the model, or even no context at all.\n\nOur aim is to find out which way of giving information lets the model do its best job in terms of making fewer mistakes and keeping the text clear and well-organized.

The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T21:33:44.880835Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T21:33:44.881438Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T21:33:44.887344Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T21:33:44.881389Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T21:33:44.886284Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":118,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tyler_essay_third_paragraph = '''While some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane.'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T21:33:45.226738Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T21:33:45.227087Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T21:33:45.232905Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T21:33:45.227057Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T21:33:45.231824Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":119,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Lydia's Essay Components\n### Prompt(Lydia)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lydia_prompt = ''''''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T20:54:13.899659Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T20:54:13.899938Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T20:54:13.903387Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T20:54:13.899914Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T20:54:13.902551Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":80,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Outline given by the User(Lydia)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lydia_outline_first_paragraph = ''''''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.182384Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.182662Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.186367Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.182639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.185531Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":81,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Human Written Essay(Lydia)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lydia_essay_first_paragraph = ''''''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.460717Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.461275Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.464855Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.461249Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T20:54:14.463987Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":82,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Chang's Essay Components\n### Prompt(Chang)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chang_prompt = '''Evaluate the ethical implications of architectural design in public spaces, using Tiananmen Square as a case study.'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.016250Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.016522Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.020351Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.016498Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.019506Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":84,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Outline given by the User(Chang)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chang_outline_first_paragraph = '''Overview of Tiananmen Square's significance and thesis statement.'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.292056Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.292345Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.296302Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.292320Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T20:54:15.295472Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":85,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chang_outline_second_paragraph = '''Explanation of Tiananmen Square's design to serve people and state leaders.

The Forbidden City is one of the biggest wooden structures in the world. It was built 600 years ago and the royal family of ancient China lived there for hundreds of years. Tiananmen Square was surrounded by all of those important architects.

The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story. \n\n**Thesis:**\n\n**Personal choices play a significant role in shaping identities by influencing the narratives and experiences individuals encounter throughout life.**\n\n**Key Examples:**\n\n* Sunja's decision to be with Hansu leads to consequences that impact her future and disrupts her family's reputation.\n* H's experience in prison shapes him into a hardworking and responsible individual.\n* Harry's one-sided perspective on his relationship with Diane shapes his identity and perception of his story.<eos>\nCPU times: user 3.58 s, sys: 19.7 ms, total: 3.6 s\nWall time: 3.58 s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Example code snippet for generating the first body paragraph from an outline\ndoc = \"\"\"\nCompose a detailed body paragraph based on the theme that personal choices shape identities.

The effect of Harry's biased view on his own identity and story.\nConclude with how these stories illustrate the link between personal choices and societal expectations.\n-\n\nPersonal choices play a pivotal role in shaping identities, influencing how individuals view themselves and others, and shaping their relationships within broader societal contexts. One such example is Sunja's decision to leave Hansu and her family, which had a significant impact on both her personal and familial reputation. The stigma and embarrassment she faced led to a loss of opportunities, while the emotional turmoil inflicted on Hansu resulted in a strained relationship. However, this experience also strengthened Sunja's sense of independence and resilience, becoming instrumental in her future choices and navigating complex interpersonal dynamics.\n\nH's time in prison not only transformed him into a hardworking and responsible individual but also instilled in him a sense of purpose and responsibility. The transformative power of adversity and the newfound skills learned behind bars created a foundation of resilience, strength, and newfound appreciation for life. His transformation served as a catalyst for personal growth and a determination to live a life of integrity and purpose upon his release.\n\nConversely, Harry's biased view of himself and his inability to confront his shortcomings inadvertently shaped his identity. His self-fulfilling prophecy served as a persistent obstacle to personal development and a failure to recognize his own flaws and limitations. Harry's inability to own up to his mistakes and blame others created a barrier to genuine intimacy and hindered his ability to forge healthy relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, these stories illustrate the potent connection between personal choices and societal expectations. Sunja's decision to leave Hansu demonstrated the power of personal autonomy and resilience, while H's transformation in prison showcased the transformative effects of adversity. Harry's biased self-perception and inability to confront his shortcomings served as a cautionary tale of how societal expectations and biases can perpetuate negative self-belief and limit personal growth.<eos>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tyler_generated_second_paragraph_models_outline = '''\nPersonal choices play a pivotal role in shaping identities, influencing how individuals view themselves and others, and shaping their relationships within broader societal contexts.

Harry's biased self-perception and inability to confront his shortcomings served as a cautionary tale of how societal expectations and biases can perpetuate negative self-belief and limit personal growth.'''\ntyler_analysis_df_w_models_outline_second_paragraph = analyze_text(tyler_generated_second_paragraph_models_outline)\ndisplay(tyler_analysis_df_w_models_outline_second_paragraph[['original_token', 'token_loss', 'most_likely_token', 'loss_ratio']])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T21:53:38.670654Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T21:53:38.671000Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T21:53:39.178491Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T21:53:38.670973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T21:53:39.177588Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":148,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"    original_token  token_loss most_likely_token  loss_ratio\n0               \\n   73.802307            increa    1.000000\n1         Personal   14.702003                **    0.199208\n2         ▁choices   12.514207               ize    0.169564\n3            ▁play    3.811835               and    0.051649\n4               ▁a    0.008368                 a    0.000113\n..             ...         ...               ...         ...\n347           ▁and    0.534257               and    0.007239\n348         ▁limit    2.858231            hinder    0.038728\n349      ▁personal    0.011539          personal    0.000156\n350        ▁growth    0.210311            growth    0.002850\n351              .    0.001306                 .    0.000018\n\n[352 rows x 4 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>original_token</th>\n      <th>token_loss</th>\n      <th>most_likely_token</th>\n      <th>loss_ratio</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>\\n</td>\n      <td>73.802307</td>\n      <td>increa</td>\n      <td>1.000000</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>Personal</td>\n      <td>14.702003</td>\n      <td>**</td>\n      <td>0.199208</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>▁choices</td>\n      <td>12.514207</td>\n      <td>ize</td>\n      <td>0.169564</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>▁play</td>\n      <td>3.811835</td>\n      <td>and</td>\n      <td>0.051649</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>▁a</td>\n      <td>0.008368</td>\n      <td>a</td>\n      <td>0.000113</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>347</th>\n      <td>▁and</td>\n      <td>0.534257</td>\n      <td>and</td>\n      <td>0.007239</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>348</th>\n      <td>▁limit</td>\n      <td>2.858231</td>\n      <td>hinder</td>\n      <td>0.038728</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>349</th>\n      <td>▁personal</td>\n      <td>0.011539</td>\n      <td>personal</td>\n      <td>0.000156</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>350</th>\n      <td>▁growth</td>\n      <td>0.210311</td>\n      <td>growth</td>\n      <td>0.002850</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>351</th>\n      <td>.</td>\n      <td>0.001306</td>\n      <td>.</td>\n      <td>0.000018</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>352 rows × 4 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Third Paragraph","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndoc = f'''Please transform the following detailed discussion into a structured outline, emphasizing the thesis on how external influences like family and societal contexts shape individual identities, and include key examples from the texts: {tyler_essay_third_paragraph} '''\nmodel_out = model.generate(\n    **tokenizer(doc, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device),\n    max_new_tokens=128,\n    do_sample=False,\n    streamer=streamer\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-28T21:39:13.414819Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-28T21:39:13.415147Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-28T21:39:17.655383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-28T21:39:13.415122Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-28T21:39:17.654634Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":131,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bos>Please transform the following detailed discussion into a structured outline, emphasizing the thesis on how external influences like family and societal contexts shape individual identities, and include key examples from the texts: While some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane. \n\n**Thesis:** External influences like family and societal contexts shape individual identities.\n\n**Key Examples:**\n\n* Pachinko - \"‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here.

They believe that everything should revolve around them, and everybody else in this world is a small side character. We often don't think that there are billions of different stories happening all at the same time, which can then affect our narratives through their perspectives. The authors and filmmakers of Homegoing, Pachinko, and Stories We Tell, use the perspective of many people in similar situations to demonstrate how the narratives of people’s lives can be shaped and defined by the choices they make personally, and the people around them including their ancestors. \n\nPeople’s identities are often defined by the choices they made in the past, whether they are successful or unsuccessful, honorable or dishonorable. The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.\n\nWhile some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane.\n\n\n\n\nRevised Introduction Based on Most Likely Tokens(With Human's Outline):\n Many people believe that there is only one story going on in the world, and they are the main characters.
