We begin by selecting an existing essay and using a machine learning model to create an initial outline of it. This outline is then checked and corrected by a person to ensure it is accurate and relevant. Subsequently, we use the corrected outline to guide the ML model in writing a new version of the essay.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the original essay, written by a human, with the new one written by the model. We closely examine each word (token) in both essays and calculate how well each word fits. If the model's word is a better fit, we replace the original word with the AI's choice. This process allows us to experiment with different ways of providing information to the model, such as using just the original essay, the corrected outline, both together, the outline made by the model, or even no context at all.\n\nOur aim is to determine which method of providing information enables the model to perform its best in terms of making fewer mistakes and maintaining clear and well-organized text. If our project is successful, it would demonstrate that AI can help improve the original essay, resulting in a final piece that is clear, well-written, and enhanced with the help of the model.\n\n## Background\n\nFor this project, the primary data consists of essays from previous college courses written by the group members. This dataset was selected because it provides authentic academic writing samples that reflect the typical structures, themes, and complexity expected in college-level essays. These essays serve as an ideal basis for evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models in generating and refining academic text, as they represent real-world examples of content that students are expected to produce. Our confidence in the primary dataset stems from several factors:\n- Relevance: Essays from previous courses are directly relevant to the project's aim, which is to enhance the quality and coherence of academic essays using AI.\n- Diversity: These essays encompass a range of subjects and writing styles, providing a robust base for testing the AI's adaptability and accuracy in generating and refining text.\n- Authenticity: Using actual student essays ensures that the project results are applicable in real-world educational settings, enhancing the practical value of the research.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Team & Responsibilities\n\n- Tyler Arista\n  - Vision Statement\n  - Background\n  - Implemented Context Approaches\n    - Model Generated Outline from Human essay\n    - Generate new essay from Human Outline\n    - Generate new essay from Human outline & essay\n  - Modified Prompt Engineering Inputs\n  - Final Presentation\n- Lydia Powers\n  - Introduction\n  - Gathered Data\n  - Prompt Engineering Approaches\n  - Final Presentation\n- Chang Liu\n  - Implications\n  - Implementation\n  - Limitations & Future Directions\n  - Final Presentation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Methodology\n\n### Model Selection\nWe chose the GEMMA model from Google's Transformers library due to its advanced architecture that includes attention mechanisms, which are particularly effective for tasks involving natural language understanding and generation. The decision to utilize a pre-trained model and further fine-tune it on our specific dataset leverages the principle of transfer learning, which helps in achieving higher performance without the need for an extensive and computationally expensive training process from scratch.\n\n### Data Preprocessing\nOur dataset comprises academic essays, which we preprocessed by tokenizing using the tokenizer associated with our chosen model. This step is crucial as it converts raw text into a format that the model can understand, thereby reducing complexity and enhancing model training efficiency. Proper data structuring is key to minimizing semantic errors during generation.\n\n### Training Methodology\nThe model was fine-tuned on our academic essay dataset using a specific batch size and learning rate. We monitored the training process for signs of overfitting by evaluating the loss on a validation set at each epoch. Adjustments to learning rates were made based on the model's performance on the validation set.\n\n### Error Analysis\nError analysis involved examining the types of errors produced in the generated essays. This analysis is crucial for diagnosing issues with the model’s understanding and output, guiding subsequent rounds of fine-tuning.\n\n### Performance Evaluation\nWe employed several metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the model, including token loss and BLEU scores. These metrics help quantify how well the model performs in terms of generating coherent, grammatically correct, and contextually relevant text.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Implementation<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup and Configuration\nDetail the environment setup, including any libraries and frameworks used","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install textstat","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:23:53.275823Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:23:53.276383Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:24:07.467942Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:23:53.276350Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:24:07.467005Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Collecting textstat\n  Downloading textstat-0.7.3-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (14 kB)\nCollecting pyphen (from textstat)\n  Downloading pyphen-0.15.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (3.3 kB)\nDownloading textstat-0.7.3-py3-none-any.whl (105 kB)\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m105.1/105.1 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25hDownloading pyphen-0.15.0-py3-none-any.whl (2.1 MB)\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m2.1/2.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m41.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pyphen, textstat\nSuccessfully installed pyphen-0.15.0 textstat-0.7.3\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch, os\nimport textstat\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu, SmoothingFunction\nfrom nltk import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, TextStreamer\n# Work around a bug in the version of PyTorch and GPU hardware curretnly on Kaggle.

The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.'''\n\np1_flesch_reading_ease_second_paragraph = textstat.flesch_reading_ease(p1_essay_second_paragraph)\nprint(f\"Flesch Reading Ease: {p1_flesch_reading_ease_second_paragraph}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:27:49.813454Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:27:49.814164Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:27:49.827176Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:27:49.814123Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:27:49.826227Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Flesch Reading Ease: 77.47\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p1_essay_third_paragraph = '''While some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane.'''\n\np1_flesch_reading_ease_third_paragraph =

They believe that everything should revolve around them, and everybody else in this world is a small side character. We often don't think that there are billions of different stories happening all at the same time, which can then affect our narratives through their perspectives.

By examining the narratives of Yaa Gyasi, Min Jin Lee, and Sarah Polley, we will discover how personal choices and the choices of others shape the narratives we embrace, ultimately contributing to our personal growth and collective understanding.'''\np1_analysis_df_w_models_outline_first_paragraph = analyze_text(p1_generated_first_paragraph_models_outline)\ndisplay(p1_analysis_df_w_models_outline_first_paragraph[['original_token', 'token_loss']])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:35:31.862329Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:35:31.863117Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:35:32.096776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:35:31.863052Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:35:32.095758Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":86,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"     original_token  token_loss\n0           Despite   78.489807\n1              ▁the    1.015811\n2        ▁pervasive    8.685407\n3           ▁belief    4.847913\n4               ▁of    3.244974\n..              ...         ...\n122         ▁growth    2.388786\n123            ▁and    0.023895\n124     ▁collective    0.589745\n125  ▁understanding    0.087458\n126               .    0.031752\n\n[127 rows x 2 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>original_token</th>\n      <th>token_loss</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Despite</td>\n      <td>78.489807</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>▁the</td>\n      <td>1.015811</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>▁pervasive</td>\n      <td>8.685407</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>▁belief</td>\n      <td>4.847913</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>▁of</td>\n      <td>3.244974</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>122</th>\n      <td>▁growth</td>\n      <td>2.388786</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>123</th>\n      <td>▁and</td>\n      <td>0.023895</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>124</th>\n      <td>▁collective</td>\n      <td>0.589745</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>125</th>\n      <td>▁understanding</td>\n      <td>0.087458</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>126</th>\n      <td>.</td>\n      <td>0.031752</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>127 rows × 2 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Second Paragraph","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndoc = f'''Please convert the following detailed discussion into a structured outline, emphasizing the main thesis about how personal choices shape identities and providing key examples from the texts: {p1_essay_second_paragraph} '''\nmodel_out = model.generate(\n    **tokenizer(doc, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device),\n    max_new_tokens=128,\n    do_sample=False,\n    streamer=streamer\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-29T03:05:49.319724Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-29T03:05:49.320050Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-29T03:05:53.005280Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-29T03:05:49.320024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-29T03:05:53.004331Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bos>Please convert the following detailed discussion into a structured outline, emphasizing the main thesis about how personal choices shape identities and providing key examples from the texts: People’s identities are often defined by the choices they made in the past, whether they are successful or unsuccessful, honorable or dishonorable. The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story. \n\n**Thesis:**\n\n**Personal choices play a significant role in shaping identities by influencing the narratives and experiences individuals encounter throughout life.**\n\n**Key Examples:**\n\n* Sunja's decision to be with Hansu leads to consequences that impact her future and disrupts her family's reputation.\n* H's experience in prison shapes him into a hardworking and responsible individual.\n* Harry's one-sided perspective on his relationship with Diane shapes his identity and perception of his story.<eos>\nCPU times: user 3.68 s, sys: 28.1 ms, total: 3.7 s\nWall time: 3.68 s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"doc = \"\"\"\nCompose a detailed body paragraph based on the theme that personal choices shape identities.\n\n**Main Idea:** Personal choices play a significant role in shaping identities by influencing the narratives and experiences individuals encounter throughout life.\n\n**Detailed Outline for body Paragraph:**\n- The impact of Sunja's decision with Hansu on her and her family's reputation.\n- How H's time in prison made him a hardworking and responsible person.\n- The effect of Harry's biased view on his own identity and story.\n- Tie it back to how these stories illustrate the link between personal choices and societal expectations.\n\"\"\"\n\nmodel_out = model.generate(\n    **tokenizer(doc, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device),\n    max_new_tokens=500,  # Increase token limit to enhance detail\n    do_sample=True,  # Enable sampling for more diverse responses\n    streamer=streamer\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:28:49.126834Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:28:49.127537Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:28:58.823665Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:28:49.127507Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:28:58.822687Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bos>\nCompose a detailed body paragraph based on the theme that personal choices shape identities.\n\n**Main Idea:** Personal choices play a significant role in shaping identities by influencing the narratives and experiences individuals encounter throughout life.\n\n**Detailed Outline for body Paragraph:**\n- The impact of Sunja's decision with Hansu on her and her family's reputation.\n- How H's time in prison made him a hardworking and responsible person.\n- The effect of Harry's biased view on his own identity and story.\n- Tie it back to how these stories illustrate the link between personal choices and societal expectations.\n- Discuss how these experiences shaped the individuals' identities in noticeable ways.\n\n**Body Paragraph:**\n\nPersonal choices serve as vibrant threads that intertwine to form intricate identities.

When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane. \n\n**Thesis:** External influences like family and societal contexts shape individual identities.\n\n**Key Examples:**\n\n* Pachinko - \"‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here.

Understanding these external influences is crucial for comprehending the diversity of human experiences and the complexities of personal identity formation.'''\np1_analysis_df_w_models_outline_third_paragraph = analyze_text(p1_generated_third_paragraph_models_outline)\ndisplay(p1_analysis_df_w_models_outline_third_paragraph[['original_token', 'token_loss']])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:35:17.609585Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:35:17.609949Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:35:17.999961Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:35:17.609922Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:35:17.999113Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":84,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"    original_token  token_loss\n0         External   79.927307\n1      ▁influences    7.865835\n2            ▁play    5.458333\n3               ▁a    0.020925\n4     ▁significant    0.450013\n..             ...         ...\n240            ▁of    0.000416\n241      ▁personal    2.005162\n242      ▁identity    0.287790\n243     ▁formation    0.118826\n244              .    0.000943\n\n[245 rows x 2 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>original_token</th>\n      <th>token_loss</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>External</td>\n      <td>79.927307</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>▁influences</td>\n      <td>7.865835</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>▁play</td>\n      <td>5.458333</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>▁a</td>\n      <td>0.020925</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>▁significant</td>\n      <td>0.450013</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>240</th>\n      <td>▁of</td>\n      <td>0.000416</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>241</th>\n      <td>▁personal</td>\n      <td>2.005162</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>242</th>\n      <td>▁identity</td>\n      <td>0.287790</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>243</th>\n      <td>▁formation</td>\n      <td>0.118826</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>244</th>\n      <td>.</td>\n      <td>0.000943</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>245 rows × 2 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### P2's Essay","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndoc = f'''Please break this introduction paragraph into a detailed outline format focusing on the thesis statement and a brief introduction: {p2_essay_first_paragraph} '''\nmodel_out = model.generate(\n    **tokenizer(doc, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device),\n    max_new_tokens=300,\n    do_sample=False,\n    streamer=streamer\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T20:02:18.119804Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T20:02:18.120560Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T20:02:25.696693Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T20:02:18.120526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T20:02:25.695851Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":134,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bos>Please break this introduction paragraph into a detailed outline format focusing on the thesis statement and a brief introduction: When I first start reading the passage, I think about what Okonkwo is eating.

His unusual eating habits, particularly his fondness for locusts, reveal a deep connection to nature and his heightened awareness of impending danger. While locusts hold cultural significance in Igbo society, their rarity and association with death suggest a deeper connection between Okonkwo and the forces of mortality. This connection becomes even more poignant when considered in light of Okonkwo's lack of familiarity with locusts and his potential reluctance to consume them. This paradox invites further exploration into the intricate relationship between humans and nature in Igbo culture.<eos>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### P3's Essay","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndoc = f'''Please break this introduction paragraph into a detailed outline format focusing on the thesis statement and a brief introduction: {p3_essay_first_paragraph} '''\nmodel_out = model.generate(\n    **tokenizer(doc, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device),\n    max_new_tokens=400,\n    do_sample=False,\n    streamer=streamer\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T20:05:40.258233Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T20:05:40.259336Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T20:05:47.669823Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T20:05:40.259301Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T20:05:47.668893Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":137,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bos>Please break this introduction paragraph into a detailed outline format focusing on the thesis statement and a brief introduction: Tiananmen Square is mostly ethical because it was designed to serve the people and the state leaders in many ways, it was surrounded by important buildings, and it had three entrances each serving in a different way.  \n\n**Thesis Statement:** While Tiananmen Square may have had some shortcomings, its design and layout ultimately served the people and the state leaders by creating a space for public assembly, facilitating communication, and promoting national unity.\n\n**Outline:**\n\n**I.

Its iconic design and layout, a testament to human ingenuity, have shaped the city's identity and served as a focal point for public life for decades. While criticisms of its shortcomings are valid, it is undeniable that the square's design and layout ultimately served the people and the state leaders by creating a space for public assembly, facilitating communication, and promoting national unity.\n\nThis paper will explore the design features of Tiananmen Square and how its layout was intended to serve the people and the state leaders. We will examine how the square provided a platform for public assembly, facilitated communication and interaction among different groups, and fostered a sense of national unity. By delving into these aspects, we aim to understand the complex interplay between design, context, and the aspirations of those who shaped this iconic space.<eos>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model Generates Paragraph from Human Written Outline\nThis approach uses a ready-made outline created by a human to help write a detailed paragraph.

Authors and filmmakers alike emphasize the significance of individual agency within broader historical and social contexts.

This interconnectedness emerges from the shared experiences, histories, and social contexts that shape the lives of individuals and communities. As illustrated by the narratives of Isak, Esi, and Diane, individuals are not isolated entities but are shaped by the benevolent actions of others, the legacy of the past, and the choices made by their parents and ancestors.\n\nThis interconnectedness is evident in the choices and decisions made by characters in literary works. Isak’s decision to marry Sunja highlights the transformative power of benevolent actions, redirecting her life trajectory towards a more fulfilling path. Esi and her descendant Ness bear the burden of the legacy of slavery, shaping their identities and opportunities long after the original events have passed. Similarly, Diane’s decision to raise her children based on her own experiences underscores the profound impact of parental choices on children’s identities and their understanding of family narratives.\n\nBy exploring the interconnectedness of personal histories, this theme underscores the power of social context in shaping individual lives. It challenges the notion of individual agency and emphasizes the role of social forces in determining personal experiences. This understanding is crucial for fostering empathy and promoting social justice, as it encourages us to acknowledge the interconnectedness of our world and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society.<eos>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p1_generated_third_paragraph_human_outline = '''By exploring the interconnectedness of personal histories, this theme underscores the power of social context in shaping individual lives and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the collective and historical forces that influence personal experiences.

They believe that everything should revolve around them, and everybody else in this world is a small side character. We often don't think that there are billions of different stories happening all at the same time, which can then affect our narratives through their perspectives.

The paragraph will thoroughly analyze and discuss the specific elements highlighted in the outline, all while drawing on examples from the referenced essay to enrich the discussion.\n\n**Essay Context:** People’s identities are often defined by the choices they made in the past, whether they are successful or unsuccessful, honorable or dishonorable. The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.\n\n**Outline for Second Paragraph:**\n\nMain idea: Personal decisions directly shape characters' identities and futures in all three works, highlighting the authors' and filmmaker's focus on the impact of individual agency within broader historical and social contexts.\nExplanation: This exploration of personal choice aligns with the creators' views that history is not merely a series of events but a complex tapestry woven from individual actions and their consequences.\nExample from Pachinko: Sunja's pivotal decision to engage with Hansu, and its ramifications, showcase how personal mistakes and moral dilemmas are central to character development and plot progression.\nExample from Homegoing: The character H’s experience with forced labor and subsequent physical development illustrates how personal endurance and adaptation to circumstances reflect broader historical forces like slavery and institutional racism.\nExample from Stories We Tell: Harry’s narrative and his one-sided love affair demonstrate how personal perceptions can deeply influence one’s identity and the stories they choose to tell or believe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy examining how personal choices shape identities in these three works, this paragraph aims to demonstrate how individual agency contributes to the richness and complexity of human experience.<eos>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p1_generated_second_paragraph_human_outline_and_essay = '''In conclusion, the exploration of personal choice in these three works underscores the transformative power of individual agency within broader historical and social contexts.

The paragraph should delve into the details, providing a thorough analysis and discussion of the specific aspects of the topic mentioned in the outline and illustrated by the referenced paragraph.\n\n**Essay Context:** While some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane.\n\n**Outline for Second Paragraph:**\n\nMain idea: Characters’ identities and life paths are significantly influenced by the actions and statuses of those around them and their ancestors, emphasizing the interconnectedness of personal histories within larger societal narratives.\nExplanation: This theme underscores the authors' and filmmaker's perspective that individual lives are not isolated but are deeply affected by the historical and relational contexts in which they exist, echoing a broader theory that history is constructed collectively rather than singularly.\nExample from Pachinko: Isak’s altruistic decision to marry Sunja provides a stark contrast to her initial dilemma, showing how benevolent actions from others can redirect an individual’s life trajectory dramatically.\nExample from Homegoing: The legacy of slavery, as seen through Esi and her descendant Ness, highlights how ancestral histories cast long shadows over the lives of future generations, shaping identities and opportunities long after the original events have passed.\nExample from Stories We Tell: The revelation of Sarah’s true paternity and Diane’s decisions regarding her upbringing illustrate the profound impact parental choices have on children’s identities and their understanding of family narratives.\n\n**Conclusion:** By exploring how characters’ identities are shaped by the actions and contexts of others, this theme underscores the interconnectedness of personal histories and the role of history in shaping individual lives.<eos>\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p1_generated_third_paragraph_human_outline_and_essay = '''By exploring how characters’

By exploring the interplay between historical context, architectural design, and social dynamics, this essay seeks to challenge the simplistic narrative of Tiananmen Square as a symbol of ethical conduct and highlight its potential to perpetuate social inequalities.'''\np3_analysis_df_w_human_outline_and_essay_first_paragraph = analyze_text(p3_generated_first_paragraph_human_outline_and_essay)\ndisplay(p3_analysis_df_w_human_outline_and_essay_first_paragraph[['original_token', 'token_loss']])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T20:15:02.994074Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T20:15:02.994634Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T20:15:03.291932Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T20:15:02.994601Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T20:15:03.291025Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":151,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"    original_token  token_loss\n0         Standing   74.302307\n1            ▁tall    1.614646\n2              ▁in    1.310400\n3         ▁Beijing   10.723093\n4                ,    0.418464\n..             ...         ...\n141            ▁to    0.419028\n142    ▁perpetuate    1.306165\n143        ▁social    1.258569\n144  ▁inequalities    1.200097\n145              .    0.284939\n\n[146 rows x 2 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>original_token</th>\n      <th>token_loss</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Standing</td>\n      <td>74.302307</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>▁tall</td>\n      <td>1.614646</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>▁in</td>\n      <td>1.310400</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>▁Beijing</td>\n      <td>10.723093</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>,</td>\n      <td>0.418464</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>141</th>\n      <td>▁to</td>\n      <td>0.419028</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>142</th>\n      <td>▁perpetuate</td>\n      <td>1.306165</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>143</th>\n      <td>▁social</td>\n      <td>1.258569</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>144</th>\n      <td>▁inequalities</td>\n      <td>1.200097</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>145</th>\n      <td>.</td>\n      <td>0.284939</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>146 rows × 2 columns</p>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Essay Results","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Original Essay for Reference\nThis section focuses on the analysis of a single essy to maintain clarity and orgnanization throughout the project.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Original Essay(P1):\\n\\n\", p1_essay_first_paragraph + \"\\n\\n\" + p1_essay_second_paragraph + \"\\n\\n\" + p1_essay_third_paragraph)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:36:26.335226Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:36:26.336113Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:36:26.341348Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:36:26.336077Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:36:26.340217Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":93,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Original Essay(P1):\n\n Many people believe that there is only one story going on in the world, and they are the main characters. They believe that everything should revolve around them, and everybody else in this world is a small side character. We often don't think that there are billions of different stories happening all at the same time, which can then affect our narratives through their perspectives. The authors and filmmakers of Homegoing, Pachinko, and Stories We Tell, use the perspective of many people in similar situations to demonstrate how the narratives of people’s lives can be shaped and defined by the choices they make personally, and the people around them including their ancestors. \n\nPeople’s identities are often defined by the choices they made in the past, whether they are successful or unsuccessful, honorable or dishonorable. The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.\n\nWhile some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Generated Introduction Paragraph Based On Most_likely_token(NO CONTEXT, just most_likely_token Chosen)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p1_most_likely_token_first_paragraph = \"\".join(p1_analysis_df_w_no_context_first_paragraph['most_likely_token'])\np1_most_likely_token_second_paragraph = \"\".join(p1_analysis_df_w_no_context_second_paragraph['most_likely_token'])\np1_most_likely_token_third_paragraph = \"\".join(p1_analysis_df_w_no_context_third_paragraph['most_likely_token'])\n\nprint(\"Revised Essay Based on Most Likely Tokenn/No Context(P1):\\n\", p1_most_likely_token_first_paragraph + \"\\n\" + p1_most_likely_token_second_paragraph + \"\\n\" + p1_most_likely_token_third_paragraph)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:36:27.123851Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:36:27.124771Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:36:27.131307Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:36:27.124735Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:36:27.130018Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":94,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Revised Essay Based on Most Likely Tokenn/No Context(P1):\n  increa people believe that the is a one true to on in the universe. and that call unwilling ones characters in This believe that their that fit around them and and that else is the story is simply supporting character character.\n\n need see't see about there are multiple of other stories happening at at once same time, but is make lead our perception. the focus and\n\n idea of artists who these Alone explore Chiinko, and Things of Tell use for their concept of African characters to the situations to explore the the power are these ofs lives intertw intertw interconnected by influenced by the choices they make. and and how impact they them. the families.\n\n\n increa oftens Republic are shaped shaped by their roles they make in life past. and consciously were good or unsuccessful. and or dishonorable.\n\n choices of editors who this narratives often a choices person’s identity define shape their destiny and\n\n this context “ “inko, Y Jin Lee, the see encounter the impact of the eyes of aja, who also also also get glimpses see at the hear the stories and other other around to her.

The multiplicity of stories that populate our world reflects the richness and complexity of human experience, offering a wealth of insights into our own lives and the world around us. This paper delves into the power of narratives, exploring how they shape our perspectives, influence personal and collective consciousness, and provide context and meaning. By examining the narratives of Yaa Gyasi, Min Jin Lee, and Sarah Polley, we will discover how personal choices and the choices of others shape the narratives we embrace, ultimately contributing to our personal growth and collective understanding.\nPersonal choices serve as vibrant threads that intertwine to form intricate identities. They influence the narratives and experiences individuals encounter throughout life, shaping the narratives they tell about themselves and the world around them. Notably, Sunja's decision to leave Hansu and their family's reputation hanging had a profound impact on both her and her family. It shifted the narrative around them, highlighting the painful realities of ostracism and the importance of truth. Conversely, H's time in prison transformed him into a hardworking and responsible individual. The confinement stripped away his vices and forced him to confront his mistakes. This period of hardship sculpted his character, making him stronger and more determined to build a better future for himself and his loved ones. Furthermore, Harry's biased view towards his own race had a significant impact on his identity and perception. The constant judgment and prejudice he encountered shaped his self-esteem and made it difficult to form genuine connections. The experience taught him the power of introspection and the importance of challenging biases. These stories illustrate the intricate connection between personal choices and societal expectations. Sunja's decision to set herself free was a testament to her individuality and her refusal to be defined by her association with Hansu. H's struggle in prison challenged his societal conditioning and encouraged him to question his perceptions. And Harry's journey taught him the importance of self-reflection and the need to embrace diversity.\nExternal influences play a significant role in shaping individual identities, particularly through the contexts of family and society. As illustrated through the narratives of 'Pachinko', 'Homegoing', and 'Stories We Tell', individuals are shaped by societal pressures, forced labor conditions, and the revelation of unexpected personal information. In 'Pachinko', Yangjin's decision reflects societal pressures, where a daughter's life is valued more for her potential than her own happiness. Similarly, Ness's identity is shaped by the brutal realities of forced labor, where physical and emotional suffering become defining aspects of her being. The revelation of Sarah's paternity in 'Stories We Tell' highlights the unexpected nature of identity formation. It forces her to confront the complexities of family relationships and the challenges of piecing together her own personal history. These examples illustrate how external influences can disrupt existing identities and necessitate the formation of new ones. In conclusion, external influences shape individual identities by dictating choices and life paths. From societal pressures and forced labor to unexpected personal information, these forces influence how individuals perceive themselves and navigate their place in the world. Understanding these external influences is crucial for comprehending the diversity of human experiences and the complexities of personal identity formation.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Generated Introduction Paragraph Given Desired Human Outline","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\nEssay Generated by Model:\\n\\n\", p1_generated_first_paragraph_human_outline + \"\\n\\n\" + p1_generated_second_paragraph_human_outline + \"\\n\\n\" + p1_generated_third_paragraph_human_outline)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:36:28.715734Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:36:28.716493Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:36:28.721203Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:36:28.716460Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:36:28.720074Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":96,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nEssay Generated by Model:\n\n This paper investigates how authors and filmmakers utilize multiple perspectives to depict the complexities of personal and ancestral choices, challenging traditional narratives and emphasizing the power of individual narratives to shape identity and history. By examining the works of Yaa Gyasi, Min Jin Lee, and Sarah Polley, this paper argues that personal and ancestral choices are not merely individual experiences but are also shaped by broader historical contexts, familial dynamics, and societal narratives.This paper seeks to demonstrate how authors and filmmakers employ multiple perspectives to illuminate the multifaceted nature of human experience, emphasizing the role of personal narratives in understanding the complexities of identity and history.\n\nBy examining these works through a lens of personal agency, this analysis underscores the importance of individual choice in shaping narratives and understanding the complex interplay between personal experiences, historical contexts, and societal structures. The narratives of Sunja, H, and Harry in Pachinko, Homegoing, and Stories We Tell reveal a recurring theme of the profound impact of personal decisions on shaping characters' identities and futures. Authors and filmmakers alike emphasize the significance of individual agency within broader historical and social contexts. This exploration aligns with the creators' belief that history is not merely a series of events but a tapestry woven from individual actions and their consequences. Through close examination of these works, we witness how personal choices serve as catalysts for character development and plot progression. Sunja's decision to engage with Hansu, despite societal disapproval, exemplifies how individual agency can lead to unexpected consequences and personal growth. H's experience with forced labor compels him to confront the limitations of his own body and the systemic oppression he has endured. Harry's narrative, marked by his one-sided love affair, highlights how personal perceptions can shape one's identity and the stories they choose to tell.\n\nBy exploring the interconnectedness of personal histories, this theme underscores the power of social context in shaping individual lives and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the collective and historical forces that influence personal experiences. The intricate tapestry of human identity is intricately woven with the threads of those around us and our ancestors, creating a complex and interconnected narrative that unfolds through generations. This interconnectedness emerges from the shared experiences, histories, and social contexts that shape the lives of individuals and communities. As illustrated by the narratives of Isak, Esi, and Diane, individuals are not isolated entities but are shaped by the benevolent actions of others, the legacy of the past, and the choices made by their parents and ancestors. This interconnectedness is evident in the choices and decisions made by characters in literary works. Isak’s decision to marry Sunja highlights the transformative power of benevolent actions, redirecting her life trajectory towards a more fulfilling path. Esi and her descendant Ness bear the burden of the legacy of slavery, shaping their identities and opportunities long after the original events have passed. Similarly, Diane’s decision to raise her children based on her own experiences underscores the profound impact of parental choices on children’s identities and their understanding of family narratives. By exploring the interconnectedness of personal histories, this theme underscores the power of social context in shaping individual lives. It challenges the notion of individual agency and emphasizes the role of social forces in determining personal experiences. This understanding is crucial for fostering empathy and promoting social justice, as it encourages us to acknowledge the interconnectedness of our world and to work towards creating a more just and equitable society.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Genereated Introduction Paragraph Given Human Essay & Outline","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"\\nEssay Generated by Model:\\n\\n\", p1_generated_first_paragraph_human_outline_and_essay + \"\\n\\n\" + p1_generated_second_paragraph_human_outline_and_essay + \"\\n\\n\" + p1_generated_third_paragraph_human_outline_and_essay)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T17:36:31.707775Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T17:36:31.708392Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T17:36:31.713357Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T17:36:31.708359Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T17:36:31.712447Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":97,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\nEssay Generated by Model:\n\n In the tapestry of human existence, where narratives intertwine, revealing the complexities of our individual journeys, we often find ourselves questioning the singular, dominant narrative that pervades our understanding of the world.

This essay explores how authors and filmmakers utilize multiple perspectives to illustrate how personal and ancestral choices shape individual narratives and identities, challenging our assumptions about the nature of history and storytelling.\n\nIn conclusion, the exploration of personal choice in these three works underscores the transformative power of individual agency within broader historical and social contexts. By examining how characters navigate their choices and their consequences, these narratives challenge the notion of predetermined destinies and emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and agency in shaping one’s identity and future.\n\nBy exploring how characters’ identities are shaped by the actions and contexts of others, this theme underscores the interconnectedness of personal histories and the role of history in shaping individual lives.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Revising the Essay based on Token Loss","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def create_optimized_paragraph_based_on_token_loss(original_df, generated_df):\n    optimized_tokens = []\n\n    original_df = original_df.reset_index(drop=True)\n    generated_df = generated_df.reset_index(drop=True)\n\n    for index, orig_row in original_df.iterrows():\n        if index < len(generated_df):\n            gen_row = generated_df.iloc[index]\n            if orig_row['token_loss'] <= gen_row['token_loss']:\n                optimized_tokens.append(orig_row['original_token'])\n            else:\n                optimized_tokens.append(gen_row['original_token'])\n        else:\n            optimized_tokens.append(orig_row['original_token'])\n\n    optimized_paragraph = ''.join(optimized_tokens).replace('▁', ' ')\n    return optimized_paragraph","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T19:58:32.254150Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T19:58:32.254542Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T19:58:32.261840Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T19:58:32.254513Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T19:58:32.260920Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":127,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Generate an Outline from Human Written Essay & Revise that Outline to Generate a New Paragraph\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"p1_generated_first_paragraph_models_outline_df = analyze_text(p1_generated_first_paragraph_models_outline)\noptimized_paragraph = create_optimized_paragraph_based_on_token_loss(\n    p1_analysis_df_w_no_context_first_paragraph, \n    p1_generated_first_paragraph_models_outline_df\n)\n\nprint(\"Optimized Paragraph:\")\nprint(optimized_paragraph)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-30T18:03:05.559870Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-30T18:03:05.560565Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-30T18:03:05.820387Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-30T18:03:05.560528Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-30T18:03:05.819486Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":118,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Optimized Paragraph:\nMany the believe that of is singular one dominating the on in, the, is far more nuanced. characters. of believe that everything our world around the richness and complexity of human experience world is a wealth of character. our often lives't world around us.

This essay the how of and people utilize to her. In the personal, it choices shape “ narratives and did not challenging her, about the nature of history and would. disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Results(Quantitative)\n## BLEU SCORES\nThe BLEU score helps us measure the linguistic similarity between the human-written essays and the AI-generated ones.

This approach yielded a BLEU score of 0.1311, suggesting a low similarity to the original academic texts, though it was relatively easy to read with a Flesch Reading Ease score of 68.5. We then experimented with generating an outline from a human-written essay and subsequently revising that outline to create a new paragraph. This method resulted in a BLEU score of 0.1902, indicating better alignment with the academic style, although the readability significantly decreased, evidenced by a Flesch score of 16.02. This drop suggests that the text became more complex and structured, aligning more closely with traditional academic writing. Another approach involved using a human-written outline directly to generate text, which produced a BLEU score of 0.1860 and a slightly improved readability score of 19.4, showing that using human-driven outlines helps maintain a balance between content accuracy and complexity. Lastly, providing both a human-written essay and an outline to guide the generation resulted in the highest BLEU score of 0.1930, indicating the closest match to the original style of academic writing, with the Flesch score reaching the lowest at 14.12, which suggests the text was quite dense and possibly the most challenging to read. Each method has demonstrated unique strengths and weaknesses, making the choice of approach dependent on whether readability or adherence to academic style is more crucial for the specific needs of your project.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Limitations & Future Directions\n## Data Limitation: \nThe quality and extent of the dataset used for training the machine learning model greatly influence the performance and reliability of the generated essays.
