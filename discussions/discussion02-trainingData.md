# Training Data

## Tell your classmates something interesting or concerning about the datasets that generative AI models were trained on

Something concerning about the datasets that generative AI models, like the Conditional Augmentation GAN(CA-GAN), use for medical research is their lack of equal representation. For example, datasets from sources like the MIMIC-III database mainly include patients from specific ethnic groups and genders, but do not represent diverse populations well. So, when generative AI models trained on data that is used to create synthetic data for medical research, they might not be the best to accurately represent other racial groups like Hispanics or Asians.<br>

Also, these datasets can suffer from imbalance, meaning there may be fewer samples from certain groups or conditions. This imbalance can cause unfair or wrong results when using the data. Because medical decisions and research results can be greatly affected, it's crucial to fix these biases and limitations to make sure everyone is represented fairly and the results are correct.<br>
