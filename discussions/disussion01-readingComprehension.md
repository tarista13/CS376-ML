# How do we hold big orgs like OpenAI and Google to accountable for claims they make about their models? One way is to explicitly benchmark them.

I chose the reading comprehension benchmark to evaluate myself, ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), and Perplexity Labs' Playground.<br>

In this task, I provided each model with a short passage/example datapoint from the dataset. Then, I asked each model a few questions with four options to choose from:

 

Passage:

- No matter where he lives, 16-year-old Danny Lopez feels like an outsider: he is half-Mexican and half-white. At his private high school in wealthy northern San Diego, California, US, Lopez is too brown to fit in, whereas for the Mexican side of his family in National City, just a dozen miles from the border, he is too white to belong. Different from both sides, Lopez is silent in school. He focuses on his passion for baseball and working hard to improve the pitches that have kept him off the school team. Mexican Whiteboy, by Matt de la Pena, is about a teenager's search for identity. It was named as one of the Top Ten Best Books for Young Adults in 2009 by the US Young Adult Library Services Association. When Lopez's mother decides to go to live with her wealthy white boyfriend in San Francisco, he chooses to spend the summer with his father's family in San Diego. It's a trip to explore roots and self-identity, filled with unexpected friendship. There he meets Uno, of mixed heritage like himself, also with a divorced mom. Uno understands Danny's split background and helps him improve his baseball skills. Both boys have big league dreams, but they both have to learn to come to terms with their mixed heritages before they can achieve their goals. Aside from discussions of racism, Mexican Whiteboy takes on other issues, such as the importance of family and the negative influence of hiding the truth. It also shows how sports can draw cultures together.

I don't believe that the task I chose was very difficult. It simply required careful reading and comprehension to be able to answer these questions. While I was able to easily answer each of the questions, ChatGPT got one question wrong, and Perplexity Labs' Playground got 2 questions wrong. So, while ChatGPT performed alright, Perplexity Labs' didn't perform too well.  I do believe that this task is a good indicator of how well someone or something understands language because it demonstrates situations where understanding written material is important. Assessing how well ChatGPT and Perplexity Labs' Playground can comprehend and respond to text-based questions provides important insights into their language comprehension abilities.
