The authors and filmmakers of these stories demonstrate how a person’s choices can shape their narratives. In the novel, Pachinko by Min Jin Lee, we mainly see the story through the viewpoint of Sunja, but we will occasionally get to look through or see the thoughts of the people close to her. In the novel, it states, “If he did not marry her, she was a common slut who would be disgraced forever. The child would be another no-name bastard. Her mother’s boardinghouse would be contaminated by her shame”(Lee 49). Sunja made a big mistake by being with Hansu, and she paid the price. She was now pregnant, and the father of the child won’t be able to marry her because he is already married. In her society, bearing a child without a father will lead to having the mother, in this case, Sunja, be disowned. It could also lead to her family and her child being disowned as well. Looking through the lens of Sunja, we could see how devastated she was and the impact her decisions could make on her in the future. Also, in the novel, Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi, we see through many different lenses in many different generations. In the chapter about H, it states, “The boss man was called Mr. John. He asked to take off his shirt. He inspected the muscles on his back and his arms and whistled. ‘Any man what can spend ten years working at Rock Slope and live to tell about it’s worth watching”(Gyasi 169). When H was sent to me while he was arrested, he might not have had an option on whether or not he wanted to work, but it made him better in the long run. He had gotten physically strong, and when he had gotten released, he was able to find a mining job that paid him. The situation he was put in shaped the person that H was. He became a hard worker and he made sure he did his job. Those were some of the things that he learned while he mined for the jail, but he was able to apply those lessons to the real world and shaped him to be somebody that was hirable. Another example of identities being defined by self choices is in the documentary, Stories We Tell, produced by Sarah Polley. When Harry met with Diane when she traveled to Montreal for a play, Harry fell in love with her. He had his own one-sided story, where he thought he was going to be with Diane for the rest of his life. This ultimately shaped his identity for the future. At the end of the documentary, Sarah asked Harry whether he liked that many people are sharing their sides of the story or if he disliked it. He shared that he did not like how many people shared their sides because he thought it was only his story to tell. He got wrapped up in the sense that Diane only loved him, and that changed the way he viewed his story.'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.688714Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.688984Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.700670Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.688962Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.699909Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"human_essay_third_paragraph = '''While some believe that their identity is solely based on their choices, people’s identities can be altered by the people around them and by their ancestors. When we start looking through the other lenses of people in the same situation, we can see that many times the expected outcome is different from reality. In the novel, Pachinko, it states, “‘Of course it would be far better for them if she went away’ Yangjin replied, knowing the hard truth. ‘The child would have a terrible life here. You’d be saving my daughter’s life as well'”(Lee 74). Isak knew the dilemma Sunja was in and he knew this was something that shouldn’t be taken lightly. After coming up with the idea of marrying Sunja and giving the child his last name, he had lifted the burden off Sunja and her child’s back. They would no longer have to bear the weight of being dishonored by society and her family. Having people who can have a different perspective of the matter, can allow one to alter the course of somebody. Then, in the novel, Homegoing, we were able to witness the identities being altered because of their past relatives. In the novel, it states, “Every day, Ness picked cotton under the punishing eye of the southern sun. She had been at Thomas Allan Stockham’s Alabama plantation for three months”(Gyasi 70). Ness was a descendant of Esi in this story. Esi was a part of the slave trade system and her life was very rough. Esi went through an enormous amount of abuse and unbearable situations. Since being in that slave system, it had affected the rest of her family tree. Ness is the daughter of Esi, and so, Ness had to bear the identity of being a slave just like her mother. She had to be a slave on a plantation and no choice she made would be able to change that in this system. Her identity at the time was determined by her mother and how she was a part of the system. Lastly, in the documentary, Stories We Tell, Sarah’s identity was shaped by the choices her mother made when she was alive. Sarah never knew that Michael was not her biological father until she grew up. Sarah was able to form a strong bond with Michael, and that was because Diane decided to have Michael take care of her instead of Harry. Once Sarah found out that Harry was her father, Sarah was still able to keep the close relationship with Michael even after finding out the truth. Sarah was able to keep her identity from the one she formed with Michael, and that was all due to Diane.'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.703439Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.703693Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.714006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.703671Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-04-26T03:18:57.713237Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#
